# Context

**A Proof of Concept (POC)** is typically a small project created to test whether a certain idea or approach is feasible. Itâ€™s not intended to be a final product but rather a prototype to demonstrate and validate key concepts and functionalities. Here applied to a **Product Lifecycle Management (PLM)** software editor: collaborative product design solution (satellites, aircraft, car, clothing, robots, ...). Product conception requires to manage its data.

# Business
- **Part:** represents a physical element or set of physical elements. For instance, a car (product) is composed, among others, of 4 wheels (4 occurrences of the Part "Wheel"). The wheel it self is composed by 1 wheel rim (1 occurrence of the Part "Rim"), 1 tyre (1 occurrence of the Part "Tyre") and X nuts (X occurrences of the Part "Nuts")

- **Document:** represents the documentation (Studies, business requirements, tests, maintenance, ...). A Document can be linked to a Part, in such case both share the same life cycle template and all actions applied to the part is automatically applied to all linked documents 
# Key Points

1. **Part-Centric Approach**:
    - Each part is an object with properties (metadata) such as name, version, state, etc.
    - Parts are linked to documents.
    - Parent-child relationships exist between parts, managing hierarchical structures.
<br></br>
2. **Services**
(operations) that can be performed on parts:
    - **Reservation**: In a collaborative context, modifying an entity requires to reserve it as first to avoid concurrent updates.
    - **Lifecycle Management**: All entity evolve over time, it goes through different steps named **lifecycle states**. Each entity has a defined set of lifecycle states which is named the **lifecycle template**. For exemple a design Part freshly created by a designer starts in the "In progress" state. Once the designer job is done, it must be validated by other people and so the Part goes in the "Under validation" state. When the design, of the Part, has been validated, it goes into the final state, "Release".
    - **Versioning**: An entity in its final life cycle state can restart a new cycle by creating a new version if some modifications are required. The first version is not lost and still exist.
      <br></br>

3. **Rules** governing how parts can be manipulated, ensuring data integrity and preventing conflicting changes:
    - **Only reserved parts can be modified:** entity can only be updated if reserved and only by the user who reserved them.
    - **Prevent lifecycle state changes on reserved parts:** Entity's lifecycle state cannot be modified if reserved.
    - **Final state management:** Entity in its final lifecycle state cannot be reserved and its lifecycle state cannot be modified.
    - **Transition to new versions only from finalized parts:** Entity new version can be created only if the current version is in its final lifecycle state.
    - **Service Appliance:** A service cannot be applied to a document linked to a Part, services must be launched from the Part and are automatically applied to all linked documents
    - **Rule Violation Notifications:** if a service cannot be executed due to one of previous rules, the invoker must be notified with an explicit reason.

# Mission

**Timeframe:** 72h

**Stack:**
- Java (language)
- Spring (development framework)
- Hibernate (ORM framework)

**Focus**
- Code clarity
- Adherance to specifications
